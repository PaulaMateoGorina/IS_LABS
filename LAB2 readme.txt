Things I added to lab2:
Tutorial: on the start screen, there is a ? on the top right of the screen that shows how to play.
Changed the sounds.
Reload mechanic: The player has 10 hay bays and will have to reload once they run out by pressing the letter R.
Phase mechanic: The more sheeps the player has pacified, the faster the sheeps will spawn (with a limit).
Changed the hitbox of the sheeps so that it is more permissive.
Changed the interface, now it shows, in order, the number of sheeps you have rescued, the "lives" you have left
(number of sheeps the player can drop before it's game over) and the number of hay they can shoot before needing to reload.
Pause function with P.
